##### Overview
A "stay between the lines" game that is playable with only audio (audio is still a work in progress). 

##### Motivation
The world is severly lacking in games that are non-visual. The idea of introducing "audio-only games" is to promote gameplay to those unable to see. Aside from this obvious reason, these games can also be used as a brain exercise for those who would like to improve their responsiveness to audio input. This game can later be extended to include slower gameplay with calming sound waves that can be used (potentially) for those with anxiety or insomnia.

##### Gameplay
Can't be much simplier than this:
- Press 'a' or left arrow to move left
- Press 'd' or right arrow to move right

*Audio functionality is still in development*
